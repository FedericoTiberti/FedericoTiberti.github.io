# Control systems Engineer
I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive progress and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. 
In engineering, I don't agree with "no pain, no gain", I would prefer "no brain, no gain". Pain is guaranteed but results aren't ðŸ§   
For those who are not in the field, here's an example of a popular control system: Cruise Control.

The control systems engineer's goal is to design what's inside the red box. This is very riductive, I could write a +100pages book on the roles of a control systems engineer but, the above scheme is meant to give a great intuition!

## Projects ðŸ’»

## Work Experience ðŸ’¼
**Control Systems engineer @ Ducati Motor Holding <img src="images/ducati-logo.png" width="17"> (_April 2024 - Present; Bologna_)** 
- In the _Control Strategies & Innovation_ R&D team, I am involved in the whole V-model process.
