# Control systems Engineer
I work at Ducati, a leader in motorcycle engineering, where I have the opportunity to grow professionally while passionately contributing to innovative projects. I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive progress and am committed to continuous learning.      
In my field, I don't agree with "no pain, no gain", I would prefer "no brain, no gain". Pain is guaranteed but results aren't üß†  
For those who are not in the field, here's an example of a popular control system: Cruise Control.

The control systems engineer's goal is to design what's inside the red box. This is very riductive, I could write a +100pages book on the roles of a control systems engineer but, the above scheme is meant to give a great intuition!

## Projects üíª

## Work Experience üíº
**Control Systems engineer @ Ducati Motor Holding <img src="images/ducati-logo.png" width="17"> (_April 2024 - Present; Bologna_)** 
- In the _Control Strategies & Innovation_ R&D team, I am involved in the whole V-model process.
- As a member of this team, I am responsible for the design, implementation and validation of 3 control strategies. In addition, each of us is responsible for proposing innovative ideas to be evaluated and possibly explored. üí° 

**Internship - Electronic software engineer @ Ferrari (_October 2023 - March 2024; Maranello_)**
- In the _Sensors & Applications_ R&D team, I worked on different sensing technologies.
- I also developed a testing framework for electronic devices (mainly ECUs and sensors) using LabVIEW.

**Internship - Master thesis project on Virtual Sensing @ Toyota Motor Europe (_March 2023 - September 2023; Brussels_)**
- In the _Connected Powertrain_ R&D team, I worked on a virtual sensor project developing and deploying a machine learning model.

## Education üìö
**MSc in Control Systems Engineering (_2021 - 2023_)**
- In my master's program, I focused on control systems, studying advanced topics such as Kalman filters, nonlinear systems, Model Predictive Control and system identification algorithms.
- In 2022, I participated in two outstanding events
  1. Summer school in the Netherlands on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. During the week we went canoeing!

**BSc in Information Engineering (_2018 - 2021_)**
- Basis of the 4 pillars of information engineering: Informatics, Electronics, Telecommunications and Automation.
- In my third year, I focused on automation and completed an experimental thesis using a Crazyflie drone. Here it is a nice picture!

**High school scientific diploma (_2013 - 2018_)**

## 24h of Spa-Francorchamps 
June 2023, unforgettable!  
During my time in Brussels, I went to the 24 Hours of Spa with a car that I'm sure didn't go unnoticed! It has been simply incredible to experience the world of motorsport at one of what I believe to be in the top three circuits in the world.

## Sports over the years üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèîÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sport has been a constant passion in my life over the years. In my childhood and adolescence, I was a professional swimmer, and later became a competitive crossfitter, all while engaging in other occasional sports activities, such as climbing Mount Velino at over 2,400 meters in altitude. Swimming taught me exceptional discipline and allowed me to forge unbreakable bonds. Among the photos is a podium shared at a competition in Siena with two lifelong friends back in 2014!

## Telespazio Fucino Space Center üì°
During my last year of high school, we were fortunate to visit the largest civilian teleport in the world, just a few kilometers from the school I attended in Avezzano. It was a unique atmosphere that allowed us to experience the beginnings of telecommunications in the 1960s.
