# Control systems Engineer
I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive progress and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, I am working at Ducati, fully  
In engineering, I don't agree with "no pain, no gain", I would prefer "no brain, no gain". Pain is guaranteed but results aren't ðŸ§   
For those who are not in the field, here's an example of a popular control system: Cruise Control.

The control systems engineer's goal is to design what's inside the red box. This is very riductive, I could write a +100pages book on the roles of a control systems engineer but, the above scheme is meant to give a great intuition!

## Projects ðŸ’»

## Work Experience ðŸ’¼
**Control Systems engineer @ Ducati Motor Holding <img src="images/ducati-logo.png" width="17"> (_April 2024 - Present; Bologna_)** 
- In the _Control Strategies & Innovation_ R&D team, I am involved in the whole V-model process.
- As a member of this team, I am responsible for the design, implementation and validation of 3 control strategies. In addition, each of us is responsible for proposing innovative ideas to be evaluated and possibly explored. ðŸ’¡ 

**Internship - Electronic software engineer @ Ferrari (_October 2023 - March 2024; Maranello_)**
- In the _Sensors & Applications_ R&D team, I worked on different sensing technologies.
- I also developed a testing framework for electronic devices (mainly ECUs and sensors) using LabVIEW.

**Internship - Master thesis project on Virtual Sensing @ Toyota Motor Europe (_March 2023 - September 2023; Brussels_)**
- In the _Connected Powertrain_ R&D team, I worked on a virtual sensor project developing and deploying a machine learning model.

## Education ðŸ“š
**MSc in Control Systems Engineering (_2021 - 2023_)**
- In my master's program, I focused on control systems, studying advanced topics such as Kalman filters, nonlinear systems, and system identification algorithms.
- It is a pleasure to post here a picture of my final graduation day:

**BSc in Information Engineering (_2018 - 2021_)**
- Basis of the 4 pillars of information engineering: Informatics, Electronics, Telecommunications and Automation.
- In my third year, I focused on automation and completed an experimental thesis using a Crazyflie drone. Here it is a nice picture!

**High school scientific diploma (_2013 - 2018_)**

## 24h of Spa-Francorchamps
June 2023, unforgettable!  
During my time in Brussels, I went to the 24 Hours of Spa, immersing myself in the world of motorsport at one of what I believe to be the top three circuits in the world.
